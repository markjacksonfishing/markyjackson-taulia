Hi. Iâ€™m Marky Jackson and I am a lover of family and friends.

I am a senior software engineer at [Equinix Metal](https://metal.equinix.com) working on site reliability and the open-source [Tinkerbell](https://tinkerbell.org) project.

I was previously a [Jenkins Goverence Board as well as the Jenkins Events Officer](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/JusGlXCwbx0/m/2yHT3BFcAAAJ), a Kubernetes Org member, a [Kubernetes Release Manager Associate](https://github.com/markyjackson-taulia/sig-release/blob/master/release-managers.md), a [Continuous Delivery Foundation Ambassador](https://cd.foundation/ambassador-program-overview-application/community-ambassador-cohort20/), a [Jenkins core contributor](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/markyjackson-taulia/), a [Jenkins Google Summer of Code org admin and mentor](https://www.jenkins.io/sigs/gsoc/),a [Google Summer of Docs org admin and mentor](https://www.jenkins.io/sigs/docs/gsod/), and helped with software development and community management on the [Ortelius Project](https://ortelius.io).

I have had profiles in the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/02/18/why-i-contribute-to-the-open-source-community-and-you-should-too/) and other mediums. In the past I have  [spoken publicly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4hKSXjCqyI) and enjoyed writing [blogs on technical topics](https://cd.foundation/blog/2020/05/29/mlops-an-introduction/).

Finally, I was previously a [mentoring lead within the Kubernetes project](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/mentoring/OWNERS#L6) as well as a previous [Kubernetes Outreachy coordinator for the Kubernetes project](https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/kubernetes/).

In 2021, I decided to step back from open-source projects and focus on mental health, family and work.
