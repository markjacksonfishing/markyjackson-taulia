Hi! Super happy you found me here.

Iâ€™m Marky Jackson and I am a lover of family, friends and a die-hard San Francisco Giants fan. I left my heart in San Francisco in the summer of 2020, and now reside in San Diego, California.

I am a senior software engineer at [Equinix Metal](https://metal.equinix.com) working on the [Tinkerbell](https://tinkerbell.org) project.

I was previously a graduate student studying Data Science/Machine Learning/AI etc under [Michal Fabinger](https://fabinger.webnode.com).

I was previously a [Jenkins Goverence Board as well as the Jenkins Events Officer](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/JusGlXCwbx0/m/2yHT3BFcAAAJ), am currently a Kubernetes Org member, previously a [Kubernetes Release Manager Associate](https://github.com/markyjackson-taulia/sig-release/blob/master/release-managers.md), previously a [Continuous Delivery Foundation Ambassador](https://cd.foundation/ambassador-program-overview-application/community-ambassador-cohort20/), previously a [Jenkins core contributor](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/markyjackson-taulia/), previously a [Jenkins Google Summer of Code org admin and mentor](https://www.jenkins.io/sigs/gsoc/), previously a [Google Summer of Docs org admin and mentor](https://www.jenkins.io/sigs/docs/gsod/), and previously helped with software development and community management on the [Ortelius Project](https://ortelius.io).

I have had profiles in the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/02/18/why-i-contribute-to-the-open-source-community-and-you-should-too/), and other mediums. In the past I have  [spoken publicly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4hKSXjCqyI) and enjoyed writing [blogs on technical topics](https://cd.foundation/blog/2020/05/29/mlops-an-introduction/). Previously, I was named the [Most Valuable Jenkins Advocate](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200924005128/en/DevOps-World-2020-Award-Winners-Announced).

Finally, I was previously a [mentoring lead within the Kubernetes project](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/mentoring/OWNERS#L6) as well as a [Kubernetes Outreachy coordinator for the Kubernetes project](https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/kubernetes/) previously.

To recuiters, I am not on the market. Please do not reach out as I am very happy with working at Equinix Metal :-) We're hiring too!

In April of 2021, I again made the difficult decision to take more of a break from Open Source and focus on family and work. I have been in Open Source for the better part of 15 years and absolutely love the community and technologies. I am thankful for all those that gave me oppurtunities and all those I have met along the way.
