Hi. Iâ€™m Marky. I am an open source enthusiast who is also the Director of Open Source Software at [OpsMX](https://www.opsmx.com/company.html#team).

I am a Kubernetes Org member and a [release lead associate](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/94ec1070153406bdd97c9423efaca377af35a0bd/release-managers.md#L60), a [Continuous Delivery Foundation Ambassador](https://cd.foundation/ambassador-program-overview-application/community-ambassador-cohort20/), a [Jenkins core contributor](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/markyjackson-taulia/), and previously a Jenkins Google Summer of Code org admin and mentor.

I have had profiles in the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/02/18/why-i-contribute-to-the-open-source-community-and-you-should-too/)and other mediums. I also like [publicly speaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4hKSXjCqyI).

Finally, I get great joy out of mentoring and am a [mentoring lead within the Kubernetes project(https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/mentoring/OWNERS#L6)as well as a [Kubernetes Outreachy coordinator for the Kubernetes project](https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/kubernetes/).

I love making people smile and beleive in the power of open source. You can find me on [twitter at](https://twitter.com/markyjackson5) and on [LinkedIn at](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marky-jackson/)
