Hi. Iâ€™m Marky. I am an open-source enthusiast who is a San Francisco Giants fan, lover of family, friends, and a true believer in you.

As Director of Open-Source Software at [OpsMX](https://www.opsmx.com/company.html#team), I focus on ensuring commitment and dedication to the [Spinnaker community](https://spinnaker.io), while also ensuring that OpsMX open-source technology decisions such as enterprise architectural standards are of the utmost highest standards. 

I am a Kubernetes Org member, a [Continuous Delivery Foundation Ambassador](https://cd.foundation/ambassador-program-overview-application/community-ambassador-cohort20/), a [Jenkins core contributor](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/markyjackson-taulia/), a Jenkins Google Summer of Code org admin and mentor,and a Google Summer of Docs org admin and mentor.

I have had profiles in the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/02/18/why-i-contribute-to-the-open-source-community-and-you-should-too/) and other mediums. I also like [publicly speaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4hKSXjCqyI) and often write [blogs on technical topics](https://cd.foundation/blog/2020/05/29/mlops-an-introduction/).

Finally, I get great joy out of mentoring and am a [mentoring lead within the Kubernetes project](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/mentoring/OWNERS#L6) as well as a [Kubernetes Outreachy coordinator for the Kubernetes project](https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/kubernetes/).

I love making people smile and believe in the power of open source. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/markyjackson5) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marky-jackson/)
