Hello there! Super happy you found me here.

Iâ€™m Marky Jackson, and I am a lover of family, friends, and a die-hard San Francisco Giants fan. I left my heart in San Francisco in the summer of 2020, and now reside in San Diego, California, with my partner Julie, our three children, Bella the dog, and Locke the cat-dog.

I have had the pleasure of working with such companies as Yahoo!, Symantec, HP, Sysdig, Hightail (formally Yousendidit), Equinix Metal (formally Packt), and many more. I currently am the Chief Technologist in the Office of the CTO at Booz Allen Hamilton.

I was previously a [Jenkins Goverence Board as well as the Jenkins Events Officer](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/JusGlXCwbx0/m/2yHT3BFcAAAJ), am currently a Kubernetes Org member, a [Kubernetes project moderator co-lead](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/5783#issuecomment-841935980), previously a [Kubernetes Release Manager Associate](https://github.com/markyjackson-taulia/sig-release/blob/master/release-managers.md), previously a [Continuous Delivery Foundation Ambassador](https://cd.foundation/ambassador-program-overview-application/community-ambassador-cohort20/), previously a [Jenkins core contributor](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/markyjackson-taulia/), previously a [Jenkins Google Summer of Code org admin and mentor](https://www.jenkins.io/sigs/gsoc/), previously a [Google Summer of Docs org admin and mentor](https://www.jenkins.io/sigs/docs/gsod/), previously helped with software development, and community management on the [Ortelius Project](https://ortelius.io), previously a [mentoring lead within the Kubernetes project](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/mentoring/OWNERS#L6), a [Kubernetes Moderation Co-lead](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/moderators.md), as well as a previous [Kubernetes Outreachy coordinator for the Kubernetes project](https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/kubernetes/), previously helped with software development on the [Falco Project](https://falco.org), previosuly a member of several Kubernetes release teams in a shadow capacity, previously served on the board of directors for [Operation Dvoretskyi](https://www.operationdvoretskyi.org), and a maintainer of several Jenkins plugins, most notibly the [Jenkins Prometheus plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/prometheus-plugin).

I have had profiles in the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/02/18/why-i-contribute-to-the-open-source-community-and-you-should-too/), and other mediums. In the past I have  [spoken publicly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4hKSXjCqyI) and enjoyed writing [blogs on technical topics](https://cd.foundation/blog/2020/05/29/mlops-an-introduction/). Previously, I was named the [Most Valuable Jenkins Advocate](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200924005128/en/DevOps-World-2020-Award-Winners-Announced).

Finally, it's no secret I love food... alot. Some of my recipes as well as others awesome recipes can be found in this awesome [cloud-native cookbook](https://github.com/cncf/cloud-native-community-cookbook). 

I am taking a step back from my open-source work to focus on family and my health.
